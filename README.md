# Space Travel and Recreation System

Coursework from the University of Hertfordshire

## Overview 

A control system for the STAR organization. This organization manages a number of resorts offering space travel and recreation facilities. These resorts always consist of a number of worlds offering different leisure facilities. Each world is connected by shuttles to some of the other worlds at the resort. A card must be used to take a shuttle to journey to another world. Credits can be bought for cards and these are used when making a shuttle journey. However, there are a number of conditions that need to be met before anyone (card) can use a card for a shuttle journey.

I developed the Java code for the system in BlueJ and added the following functionalities:
a) Displays details of the whole resort
b) Lists all cards on all worlds of the resort
c) Lists all cards currently on a specified world
d) Finds the current location of a card
e) Authorises a shuttle journey, if it meets the required conditions
f) Tops up a cardâ€™s credits
g) Converts points to credits
h) Records an emergency move of a card (person) back to the homeworld
i) Records the evacuation of all cards (persons) to the home world.
